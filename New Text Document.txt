Problem description:
You are tasked to predict the price of a home-based on 79 input variables. Sale price is the output variable.

Steps to implement:
1.       Exploratory data analysis:

a.       For each categorical variable, identify the count

b.       For each numeric variable compute summary statistics

c.       For all numeric variables, find the correlation

2.       Linear regression:

a.       Divide the data into train and validation

b.       Using simple linear regression build a model on training data

c.       Now on validation data, predict the sale-price and compute Mean absolute error

d.       Identify the important variables

3.       Ridge and lasso regression

       Repeat the same steps as linear regression
